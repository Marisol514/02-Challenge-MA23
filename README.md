## 02-HTML-git-CSS - 02 Challenge

## Description
Begining with started code, the challange was to modify the code to improve whithout changing what it does. The challange is due on Thursday Dec 21, 2023. 

The challange will also require that I ensure that all the links are functional, CSS selectors are consolidated. It will require me to add a unique name, and to meet the acceptance criteria. 

I will also be rewuired to deploy the application and repository. As well as include screen shots of the deployed application and it should resemble the mock up to 90%.
